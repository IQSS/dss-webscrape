# Introduction {-}

## Table of Contents {-}

In this tutorial, we first provide an overview of some foundational concepts about the world-wide-web. We then lay out some common approaches to web scraping and compare their usage. With this background, we introduce several applications that use the Selenium Python package to scrape websites.

This tutorial is organized into the following parts:  

1. Basic concepts of the world-wide-web.       
2. Comparison of some common approaches to web scraping.       
3. Use-cases for when to use the Selenium Driver.          
4. Illustration of how to find web elements using Selenium Driver.     
5. Illustration of how to fill in web forms using Selenium Driver.

We plan to add more applications in the near future. The content of this tutorial is a work in progress, and we are happy to receive feedback! If you find anything confusing or think the guide misses important content, please email: help@iq.harvard.edu.
